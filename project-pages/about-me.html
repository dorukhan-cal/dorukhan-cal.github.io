            My journey started in Ankara, Turkey. While growing up, I would consume every piece of English medium I could; movies, tv shows and -most importantly- video games. 
            By the time I was in high school, I could pretty much speak English fluently. This allowed me the opportunity to take part in the Nova Scotia International Student Program for my last year of high school.
            Following that, in 2016, I started my Bachelor of Computer Science at Dalhousie University.

          <div class="body-text">
            My passion and love for video games never ceased, I knew I wanted to be in game development at a very young age. Finally starting my computer science education was the first step towards that goal.
            The second, and the biggest step, was my internship at Seriously Digital Entertainment over the summer of 2019. I took part in the development of Best Fiends Stars, which wasn't fully released at the time.
            I was incredibly lucky to have been surrounded by people that really wanted me succeed and learn as much as I could during my time there. 
            I saw and participated in almost every facet of game development, I contributed my piece (and even got my name in the credits!:)). 
            Most importantly, I saw that I possessed what it takes to make my dream of being in game development a reality.

            I had plans to do another internship in 2020, but the pandemic got in the way of that.
            I decided to take a few extra classes over the summer so that I could do a minor in Environment, Sustainability and Society.
            This really broadened my horizons with regards to the challenges we face as a whole species, and what needs to be done to face those challenges.
            But, it also solidified my wish to bring more happinness and joy to the world, which is what video games do!

            I've finally graduated from Dalhousie University in 2021. As I hadn't been home or seen family for a long, long few years I decided to take a gap year in Turkey during 2022.
            I spent this time honing my game development skills, be designing or making. I've gotten even more proficient with Unity and introduced myself to Unreal Engine.
            I've trained my young puppy throughout the year, got to spend time with family. Most importantly I've recharged my batteries all the way to max!
          </div>
          <div class="body-text">
            Early 2023 I've made the move to Montreal to finally make my dream of being a game developer come true. 
            I am confident I have all the skills needed, the motivation, the passion and the excitement to jump right in!
